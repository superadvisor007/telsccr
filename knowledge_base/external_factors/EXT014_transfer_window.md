## January Window
- New signings need 4-6 games to integrate
- Selling clubs show form dip
- Loaned players can't face parent club

## Summer Pre-Season
- New manager needs 10-15 games
- Major squad overhaul = slow start
- Stable squads outperform early season

## Deadline Day
- Teams missing targets show frustration
- Successful business boosts morale
