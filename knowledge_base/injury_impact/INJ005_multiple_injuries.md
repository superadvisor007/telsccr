# Multiple Injury Crisis

## Threshold Effects
| Players Out | Performance Drop |
|-------------|------------------|
| 1-2 | -5% to -10% |
| 3-4 | -15% to -20% |
| 5+ | -25% to -35% |

## Position Clustering
- Multiple CBs out = crisis
- Multiple forwards out = no goals
- Multiple mids out = no control

## Betting Strategy
- Heavy fade teams with 4+ key players out
- Wait for confirmed lineups
- Pre-match odds often wrong
