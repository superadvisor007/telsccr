# Pattern: Draw No Bet on Favorites

## Win Rate: 65-70%
## Optimal Odds: 1.35-1.50

## Logic
- Protection against lucky draw
- Reduces variance significantly
- Still captures majority of favorite wins

## Entry Criteria
- Favorite odds 1.50-2.00 on 1X2
- DNB odds > 1.30
- Favorite has better form (last 5)
- Home or neutral venue

## Best Value
- When 1X2 is 1.60 and DNB is 1.40
- Implied probability gap suggests market inefficiency
