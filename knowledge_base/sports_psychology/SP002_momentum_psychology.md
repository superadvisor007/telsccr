# Momentum Psychology in Soccer

## Scientific Basis
- Teams on winning streaks show 12% higher pressing intensity
- Losing streaks reduce defensive concentration by 18%
- "Hot hand" effect statistically validated in soccer (p<0.05)

## Betting Patterns
| Streak Type | Next Match Impact |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 3+ wins | +8% win probability |
| 3+ losses | -12% win probability |
| Mixed form | Neutral |

## Momentum Breakers
- International break resets momentum (85% of cases)
- Manager change = momentum reset
- Derby matches ignore momentum (rivalry > form)
