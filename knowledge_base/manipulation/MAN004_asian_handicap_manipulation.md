# Asian Handicap Market Integrity

## Why AH is Harder to Fix
- Precise margin required
- Both teams must cooperate for exact result
- Market very liquid, hard to move

## Reading AH for Manipulation Signs
- Steam moves (sudden sharp movement)
- Reverse line movement
- Inconsistent movement across bookmakers

## Safe Betting in AH Markets
- Follow sharp money (late line movement)
- Pinnacle as benchmark (sharpest book)
- Be wary of "traps" where line seems too good
