# Arbitrage & Value Detection

## Arbitrage Formula
1/odds1 + 1/odds2 + 1/odds3 < 1

## Example
Home: 2.10 (47.6%)
Draw: 3.50 (28.6%)
Away: 3.60 (27.8%)
Total: 104% = 4% margin (no arbitrage)

## Finding Value
Your probability: 55%
Market implied: 50% (2.00 odds)
Value = (0.55 × 2.00) - 1 = +10%

## Quick Value Check
If your edge > bookmaker margin, you have value
Typical margins: 2-8%
