# Regression to Mean in Soccer

## When Teams Overperform
- Goals > xG for 5+ matches = regression due
- Clean sheets despite high xGA = regression due
- Lucky wins (low xG but high goals) = regression due

## Regression Speed
| Metric | Games to Regress |
|--------|------------------|
| Goals vs xG | 8-12 matches |
| Points vs xPoints | 10-15 matches |
| Save % | 6-10 matches |

## Betting Application
- Fade overperformers
- Back underperformers showing good underlying stats
- xG difference >0.5 = strong regression signal
