# Bayesian Probability Updates

## Bayes Formula
P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)

## Soccer Application
Prior: Team A wins 60% at home (historical)
New evidence: Star striker injured
Likelihood: Team wins only 40% without striker

Updated probability:
P(win|injury) = 0.40 × 0.60 / 0.50 = 0.48

## Update Factors
| Event | Prior Adjustment |
|-------|------------------|
| Key player out | -10% to -20% |
| Manager sacked | -15% short term |
| Weather severe | ±5% depending on style |
| Referee strict | +10% cards, -5% goals |
