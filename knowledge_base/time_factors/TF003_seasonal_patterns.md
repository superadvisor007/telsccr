# Seasonal Betting Patterns

## August-September
- New signings not integrated
- Back settled squads
- Avoid newly promoted

## December-January
- Fixture congestion extreme
- Back deep squads
- Injury crisis common

## April-May
- Motivation varies wildly
- Check what teams play for
- Dead rubbers = unpredictable

## End of Season
- Nothing to play for = skip
- Title deciders = cagey or explosive
- Relegation battles = high intensity
