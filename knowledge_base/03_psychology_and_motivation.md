# Psychology & Motivation - The Hidden 20% Edge

## Why Psychology Matters in Betting

**Statistical Fact**: 15-25% of match outcomes are determined by psychological factors, not skill.

Bookmakers' models focus on:
- ✅ Team strength (Elo, ratings)
- ✅ Recent form
- ✅ Head-to-head
- ❌ **Motivation** (undervalued)
- ❌ **Pressure** (ignored)
- ❌ **Mental state** (not quantified)

**Betting Edge**: If you can quantify psychology, you gain 5-10% edge over market.
