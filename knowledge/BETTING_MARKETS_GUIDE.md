# Complete Betting Markets Guide for Soccer

## 📊 European Odds Format (Decimal Odds)

**Always use decimal odds (1.50, 2.00, 3.50) - NOT American (-110) or Fractional (3/1)**

### How Decimal Odds Work
- **Quote 1.50** = €1 Einsatz gewinnt €1.50 zurück (€0.50 Gewinn)
- **Quote 2.00** = €1 Einsatz gewinnt €2.00 zurück (€1.00 Gewinn)
- **Quote 3.50** = €1 Einsatz gewinnt €3.50 zurück (€2.50 Gewinn)

### Implied Probability Calculation
```
Implied Probability = 1 / Decimal Odds × 100%
```

Examples:
- Quote 1.50 → 66.7% implied probability
- Quote 2.00 → 50.0% implied probability
- Quote 2.66 → 37.6% implied probability

## 🎯 Target Markets for Low-Odds Accumulators (Quote ~1.40)

### Best Single Markets (Quote 1.15 - 1.30)
1. **Over 1.5 Goals** - Most common, 70-80% success
2. **BTTS Yes** - Open games, 55-65% success

### Double Accumulator Strategy (1.40 total)
```
Match A: Over 1.5 @ 1.18
Match B: Over 1.5 @ 1.19
Total: 1.18 × 1.19 = 1.40
```

### ⚠️ AVOID These Combinations
- ❌ Under 1.5 + Under 1.5 (Too risky, low probability)
- ❌ Under 2.5 + BTTS No (Contradictory)
- ❌ Over 3.5 + Over 3.5 (Too unpredictable)

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES FOR AI PREDICTIONS

### 1. Probability Sanity Checks
```python
# REALISTIC PROBABILITY RANGES
Over 1.5:     60% - 85%  (typical: 75%)
Over 2.5:     40% - 70%  (typical: 55%)
Over 3.5:     20% - 50%  (typical: 35%)
Under 1.5:    10% - 30%  (typical: 18%)  # RARE!
Under 2.5:    30% - 55%  (typical: 45%)
BTTS Yes:     45% - 70%  (typical: 55%)
BTTS No:      30% - 55%  (typical: 45%)
```

### 2. ❌ NEVER Predict These
- Under 1.5 with >30% probability (unless extreme circumstances)
- Over 3.5 with >60% probability
- Any market with >95% confidence (overconfidence)

### 3. ✅ ALWAYS Prefer These
- Over 1.5 Goals (safest low-odds bet)
- BTTS Yes in open games
- Double Chance for favorites

### 4. Odds Reality Check
```python
# If your probability is X%, expected fair odds = 1 / (X/100)
Probability 75% → Fair Odds = 1.33
Probability 80% → Fair Odds = 1.25
Probability 85% → Fair Odds = 1.18

# Market Odds vs Fair Odds
If Market Odds > Fair Odds → VALUE BET ✅
If Market Odds < Fair Odds → AVOID ❌
```

## 💡 Examples: Good vs Bad Predictions

### ✅ GOOD Prediction
```
Match: Bayern Munich vs Hoffenheim
Market: Over 1.5 Goals
Model Probability: 82%
Market Odds: 1.25
Fair Odds: 1.22
Edge: +2.4% (VALUE!)
Reasoning: Bayern averages 2.8 goals at home, Hoffenheim concedes 1.5 per game
Historical: Last 5 H2H all had 2+ goals
```

### ❌ BAD Prediction (Current System!)
```
Match: Werder Bremen vs Hoffenheim
Market: Under 1.5 Goals
Model Probability: 99.8%  ← ABSURD!
Market Odds: 2.66
Fair Odds: 1.002  ← IMPOSSIBLE
Edge: +165%  ← MATHEMATICALLY WRONG
Reasoning: ??? (No bundesliga match has 99.8% chance of 0-1 goals)
Historical: Bundesliga Under 1.5 rate is only ~18%
VERDICT: MODEL IS BROKEN! ❌
```

### ✅ GOOD Accumulator
```
Double:
  Match A: Bayern vs Koln - Over 1.5 @ 1.18 (80% probability)
  Match B: Dortmund vs Mainz - Over 1.5 @ 1.20 (78% probability)
Total Odds: 1.18 × 1.20 = 1.42
Combined Probability: 0.80 × 0.78 = 62.4%
Fair Odds: 1.60
Value: YES (1.42 < 1.60 but reasonable margin)
```

### ❌ BAD Accumulator
```
Double:
  Match A: Bremen vs Hoffenheim - Under 1.5 @ 2.66 (99.8% ← WRONG!)
  Match B: St. Pauli vs Leipzig - Under 1.5 @ 3.38 (95.9% ← WRONG!)
Total Odds: 2.66 × 3.38 = 8.99
Combined Probability: 0.998 × 0.959 = 95.7%
VERDICT: IMPOSSIBLE! No way two Bundesliga matches both end 0-0 or 1-0!
```

## 🔧 Quick Fix for Current System

```python
# Current system is predicting Under 1.5 with 99.8% - FIX THIS!

# REMOVE or DISABLE under_1_5 model predictions
# FOCUS on these markets instead:

RECOMMENDED_MARKETS = [
    "over_1_5",   # Most reliable (70-85% success)
    "over_2_5",   # Good for accumulators (50-65% success)
    "btts",       # Alternative option (50-65% success)
]

AVOID_MARKETS = [
    "under_1_5",  # Too rare, model is broken
    "under_2_5",  # Not suitable for low-odds strategy
]

# Probability caps
MAX_PROBABILITY = 0.90  # Never predict >90% for anything
MIN_PROBABILITY = 0.55  # Don't bet if <55% confidence

# For Over 1.5 specifically
OVER_1_5_TYPICAL_RANGE = (0.65, 0.85)  # 65-85% is realistic
```
